Kmeans Clustering-Customer Segmentation

What is Kmeans?
K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups, called clusters, where data points within each cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
Key Concepts:
1.	Cluster: A group of data points that are similar to each other based on some distance metric (usually Euclidean distance).
2.	Centroid: The center or average of all points in a cluster. It is used to represent the cluster.
3.	K: The number of clusters that you want to partition the data into. This is a hyperparameter that must be chosen beforehand.



Here Author used unsupervised learning to cluster a mall customes on the basis of Annual Income(k$) and Spending score (1-100)
Kmeans method is used to solve this problem.
Number of cluster used just random.

Result:Clusturing methods rels to making group of differnt kind of cluster in a same big group.

Conclusion: The number of group can be created more than 2 , 4 or here author has created cluster for k=8 and k=10. It is show that there no fixed amount of cluster can be created which is always right.

As you can see Kmeans cluster customer segmentation visualization in  Tablueau for k=8 and k=10. Cluster are showing different kinds of group which is not fixed.
