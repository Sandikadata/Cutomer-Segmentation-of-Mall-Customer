Kmeans Clustering-Customer Segmentation

What is Kmeans?
K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups, called clusters, where data points within each cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
Key Concepts:
1.	Cluster: A group of data points that are similar to each other based on some distance metric (usually Euclidean distance).
2.	Centroid: The center or average of all points in a cluster. It is used to represent the cluster.
3.	K: The number of clusters that you want to partition the data into. This is a hyperparameter that must be chosen beforehand.
